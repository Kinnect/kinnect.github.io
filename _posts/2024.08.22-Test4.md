# Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability across platforms, making it widely used for web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

## Jave Code Example

Here's a simple example of a Java program that prints "Hello, World!":

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
